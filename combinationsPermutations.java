// Combinations vs Permutations
//  Combinations: [1, 2, 3][1], [2], [3] , [1, 2], [1, 3] subsets-> no duplicates, r items 2, 3, 4, 5
//    To get r length of combinations from string/array, we can be able to get the subsets and return only a subset when it has length r
//    To get all combinations from empty to all combinations we keep adding to the existing subsets without any constraints
//    Incase we have duplicates in our array and we donâ€™t want duplicated values, when adding to the list of combinations:
//        For example we have an array int[ ] numArray = new int [ ] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
//        Then we have our output which will be a resizable array so we have List<List<Integer>> answer = new ArrayList<>( );
//        Which initially has an empty List<Integer> ..which we will make copy of and add it to the answer  ist.
//        So what will happen is, when we encounter duplicates? How do we ensure that we will encounter the duplicates consecutively we sort the array, and if our current nums[ I ] == nums[1] , when appending to the list we start at the previous size, which is before we added the previous duplicate number. We are doing this so that we get the permutations of this current number, with the previous duplicate number only, and not with all the numbers before the previous duplicate number, because we are sure that it has been formed.
//    The iterative approach:
                Public List<List<Integer>> findSubsets( int[ ] numbers){    

                    List<List<Integer>> answer = new ArrayList<>( ); // an empty list [[],[]]
